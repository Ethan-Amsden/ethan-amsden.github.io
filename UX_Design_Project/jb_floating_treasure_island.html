		<h1>Floating Treasure Island</h1>
		<div id="info">
			<p>Dear Visitor,<br><br>Renowned for its altitude, this mountain holds a secret treasure 
			deep within, no one has found it, but there are records nearby that tell of wealth hidden 
			within. But the mountain is full of dangerous traps and monsters. Don't believe me, I've 
			witnessed it for myself alongside many others. But watch out! the pirates too are seeking 
			the treasure and are willing to do anything to beat you to it!<br><br>Now, if you think you 
			are ready to find the hidden treasure, think again, many legends have tried and met their 
			fate! You need to go through some rigorous training under Lord Gordon to even have a chance 
			at this treasure.<br><br>Be careful out there,<br>
			Toru</p>
