				<h2>Joe's Bibliography</h2>
				<p>Joe Bartner began his working life as Steam Engine Driver for Sir Hamilton's Railway. 
					After 31 years at Sir Hamilton's Railway, Joe moved on to partner with his friend Don 
					Snarfbarger in boardgame building. While building boardgames with his friend, Joe 
					decided it was time to build a website (this website) for their latest boardgame to 
					encourage distant friends and family to explore the game and share it with others.</p>
				<p>Joe lives in the cliffside beach suburb of Emerald located on Ember Island of Australia,
					and is currently working on the boardgame, <cite>Treasure Pirates</cite>, plus an 
					educational railway videogame (not yet named).</p>

				<h2>Joe's Career</h2>
				<p>"I use to drive Steam Trains a lot. It was fun and sometimes dangerous." <br>~ Joe Bartner.</p>
				<p>After 31 years in the railway industry, I thought it be nice to help my friend Don, who 
				rode on my train quite often, with building boardgames, plus I was about to retire anyway 
				form being a Steam Engine Driver. However, I'm still asked every now and then to drive a 
				train for Sir Hamilton. He knows that I still enjoy doing it.</p>
